Requirements to run the application 
1. This chrome extension will act as server to run the application ("https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en") 
Here ia the youtube link that shows how to install the server and start the application ("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK6swHiPtew")
 used cdns for angular in the application so no need to install any angular files in the folder.
 Login and register files are create a flow for the application no validations are applied. 
 To login in to the application with out registering 
     Email : leagalfab@gmail.com
     pwd   :   legalfab
when working through the application make sure not to reload the page , the angular looses its scope there by the values won't reflect on the page.
